The credentials App Factory will use in order to fetch the Foundry application from source control on your behalf.
If you've set up your App Factory project to use a web URL -e.g.: https://acme.com/org/project.git- then create a  credential of type "Username with password" (and use either your username and password or your username and personal access token).
If you've set up your App Factory project to use an SSH URL -e.g.: git@acme.com:org/project.git- then create a credential of type "SSH Username with private key".
