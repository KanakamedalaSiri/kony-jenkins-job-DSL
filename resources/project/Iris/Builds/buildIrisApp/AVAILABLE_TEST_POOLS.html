Select the pool of devices that will be used to test your mobile app on.
If you choose a device pool, automated tests will be triggered. If you don't, no tests will be triggered.
If there are no pools in the list, you will first have to create one in order to do testing.
Note: This only applies for Android and iOS native channels.
