                This is the home of your <em>App Factory<sup>TM</sup> Microservice</em> project.<br>
                It's defined to contain a collection of <em>jobs</em> and <em>credentials</em> to help you configure
                your microservice.
            </p>
            <ul>

                    The <em>jobs</em> are predefined and you only need to worry about providing the input parameters

                    like them to use.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <a href="credentials/store/folder/domain/_/">credentials</a> are for you to define and will
                    provide your jobs with the access they'll need to integrate with other tools on your behalf.
                </li>
