            App Factory supports building Volt MX projects from code using <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/">Git</a> as a Source Code Management (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">SCM</a>) system. There are several Git vendors in the market. Knowing which vendor provides or hosts your Git server enables App Factory to better validate that the URL of the repository you've configured meets the necessary validations.<br><br>

            Also, for some vendors, this enables App Factory to be more efficient in building  your project whenever a new change is pushed into your source code repository.<br><br>

            If your vendor is not on the list, or if you're using a bare-bones Git server, select <i>"Other".</i>
